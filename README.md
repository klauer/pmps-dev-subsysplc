pmps-dev-subsysplc
=============================

This project can be used as a working example of how to use the PMPS library to implement PMPS functionality in your application. It is also used as a way to develop new PMPS functionality/ device archetypes.

Actual unit tests for the PMPS are included in the PMPS library.

A separate arbiter project contains an example arbiter deployment.
